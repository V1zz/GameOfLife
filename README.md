Game_Of_Life

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised 
by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, 
meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

What is this implementation built with?

In this project I create Life using C# and display the animated graphics model using WPF.
